## Tutorial on how to port fonts from modern studio to a older studio client
1. Open modern / normal roblox studio client.
2. Run the contents of `ModernStudioFontFix.lua` in the modern roblox studio client command bar at the bottom. This will make a GuiExports folder in **workspace**.
3. Save the GuiExports folder as a file by right clicking on it and pressing **save as a file** or you can simply copy it.
4. Insert the GuiExports file into your older roblox studio client into **workspace** (ex: 2016) or copy and paste it over into **workspace**.
5. Run the contents of `OldStudioFontFix.lua` in the older roblox studio client command bar at the bottom. This will remove the GuiExports folder and set all the fonts correctly.
